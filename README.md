## Usage

### Configs and Credentials

This tool generates temporary login URLs for the AWS Console using the credentials from a named AWS cli profile.

The configuration files for these named profiles are located at `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`.
For more information on these two file and configuring profiles, please take a look at:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

### User Federation

In the likely event that a named profile provides credentials for an IAM user (opposed to an IAM role), that user must first be federated to obtain temporary credentials.
AWS does not permit generating a Console login URL using IAM user credentials, which is why federating users is necessary.
For more information on federating credentials, please take a look at:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html

This tool will detect and automatically federate IAM users transparently.

### Examples

Generate an AWS Console login URL for the default profile:
```shell
$ aws-console
```

Or for the named "production" profile:
```shell
$ aws-console production
```

Or from the output of the aws cli itself:
```shell
$ aws sts assume-role â€¦ | aws-console -
```

---

Open the generated URL using the default browser:
```shell
$ aws-console --browser
```

Or copy the URL to the system clipboard:
```shell
$ aws-console --clipboard
```

---

Display the generated URL in the terminal as a QR code:
```shell
$ aws-console --qr
```

Or save it as an image to a file:
```shell
$ aws-console --qr > qr.png
```

---

Limit session duration to half an hour:
```shell
$ aws-console --duration 30m
```

Redirect to the IAM service after logging in:
```shell
$ aws-console --location iam
```

---

Federate the user and use the name "audit":
```shell
$ aws-console --name audit
```

Attach a readonly policy to the federated user:
```shell
$ aws-console --policy readonly
```
